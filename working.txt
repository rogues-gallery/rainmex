// Status of work

//  Branches:
//  1. Header, sync status menu, and search bar are all on their own branches now
//    - Note, header will have to merge in search bar changes before it's pushed 
        (as I based it off sync-status-menu)

//  Pickers:
//  - We use 2 different kinds of pickers. I've decided to go ahead with using the more
//    modern ones refactored and used currently everywhere in the app but in the search 
//    filters.
//  - This requires building a domains picker from scratch


// Direction of work

// Filters Pickers
// X 1. Fix build
// X 2. Move prop def'n to carried-down props
// 3. Investigate whether query value can be passed in through props

// Header
// Built out header component first draft plus stories. Haven't checked them yet.

// Misc:
// X 1. Integrate changes from lists-sidebar-group PR
// 2. Integrate feedback from Figma
//  - Sidebar hide behaviour
//  - Searchbar debounce of 500ms before search
// 3. Add link to SSM Contact Support anchor
// 4. Refactor DateRangeSelection component to styled-components
// 5. Change search bar 'Close Filters' button to have 3 states as per figma comment
